        policy push capabilities, enhancing efficiency in the insurance

        <li>
          After downloading the ZIP file, extract its contents to a location of
          your choice on your computer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Locate and run the setup file. Follow the setup wizard's instructions
          to initiate the installation process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the installation is complete, the application will automatically
          start running, and a convenient shortcut will be placed on your
          desktop for easy access.
        </li>
        <p>
          Note: <br />
          Because of how the setup file was put together, Windows might think
          it's got a virus, but it's totally clean. Just switch off your Windows
          Defender, get the setup file installed, and then switch it back on
          once you're done installing. Easy peasy!
        </p>

      <h1>Handling Errors Pushing Manually</h1>
      <p>
        When pushing policies manually, you might encounter errors, typically
        due to a poor network connection or an excessively long date range. To
        resolve these issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Network Connection: Ensure you have a strong network connection to
          prevent network-related errors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Date Range: Keep the date range within reasonable limits, preferably
          as a multiple of 5, to minimize errors.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Handling Errors Pushing Automatically</h1>
      <p>
        While pushing policies automatically, a few errors may occur, including
        the absence of text in the log file, slow automated processes, or
        unexpected errors causing the process to halt. To address these issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Network Connection: Confirm that you have a reliable network
          connection.
        </li>
        <li>
          If automatic push fails to return any messages for a specific date
          range, attempt a manual push for that range.
        </li>
        <li>
          Software Update: The software gets updated periodically so you can
          always check this site for new updates
        </li>
      </ul>
